## 🚀 How to Set Up Cloudflare WARP VPN on Ubuntu (No Zero Trust)

### ✅ Tested on: Ubuntu 22.04+ (also works on 20.04)

---

### 🧩 Step 1: Install the WARP client

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/pubkey.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/cloudflare-warp-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloudflare-warp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudflare-client.list

sudo apt update
sudo apt install cloudflare-warp
```

---

### 🛠 Step 2: Fix DNS (most networks break WARP registration)

#### Set Cloudflare DNS (system-wide) to avoid hijacked DNS:

```bash
nmcli connection show  # Find your connection name (e.g., "Wi-Fi" or "KIIT-WIFI-NET.")
```

Then run:
```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify "YOUR_CONNECTION_NAME" ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
sudo nmcli connection modify "YOUR_CONNECTION_NAME" ipv4.dns "1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1"
sudo nmcli connection down "YOUR_CONNECTION_NAME" && sudo nmcli connection up "YOUR_CONNECTION_NAME"
```

Confirm DNS is correct:
```bash
resolvectl status
```
Make sure it shows only:
```
DNS Servers: 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1
```

---

### ⚙️ Step 3: Set WARP mode (optional, but recommended)

```bash
warp-cli set-mode warp
```

This avoids using Zero Trust / Teams.

---

### 📝 Step 4: Register the client

```bash
warp-cli registration new
```

> It will open a browser window — log in or click to continue.

---

### 🔌 Step 5: Connect to WARP VPN

```bash
warp-cli connect
```

Check status:
```bash
warp-cli status
```

### 🔁 Future Usage (Quick Commands)

| Action         | Command                    |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Connect VPN    | `warp-cli connect`         |
| Disconnect VPN | `warp-cli disconnect`      |
| Status         | `warp-cli status`          |
| Restart daemon | `sudo systemctl restart warp-svc` |

---

### 🧼 Optional: Auto-connect on boot (if needed)

```bash
sudo systemctl enable warp-svc
```

---

### 💡 Tip: Avoid Zero Trust / Teams

If the app ever says you're being routed through “Zero Trust” or asks for an organization domain, run:
```bash
warp-cli set-mode warp
```

That switches you to regular WARP VPN (no login needed after registration).
